Animated-Burger-for-Mobile-Menus
================================

A menu burger that animates into an X for mobile menus. This is all compiled into one file, so that you don't need to waste any time with setup just to use a silly burger. It's done in plain html/css. With a good css processor you wont need nearly as much code.
